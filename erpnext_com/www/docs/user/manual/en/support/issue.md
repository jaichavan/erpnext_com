# Issue

**An issue is an expression of a query or dissatisfaction from your Customer. It can also be described as a report from a consumer providing review with documentation about a product or service.** 

These incoming queries are usually received via emails or 'Contact' section of the website or helpline number.

To access Issue, go to:
> Home > Support > Issue

  * The type of the issue
  * Attachments, if any

## 1. How to create an Issue



#### Discussion Thread

When a new email is fetched from your mailbox, a new Issue record is
created and an automatic reply is sent to the sender indicating the Support
Ticket Number. The sender can send additional information to this email. All
subsequent emails containing this Issue number in the subject will be
added to this Issue thread. The sender can also add attachments to
the email.

Issue maintains all the emails which are sent back and forth against
this issue in the system so that you can track what transpired between the
sender and the person responding.

#### Status

When a new Issue is created, its status is “Open”, when it is
replied, its status becomes “Waiting for Reply”. If the sender replies back
its status again becomes “Open”.

#### Closing

You can either “Close” the Issue manually by clicking on “Close
Ticket” in the toolbar or if its status is “Waiting For Reply” . If the sender
does not reply in 7 days, then the Issue closes automatically.

#### Allocation

You can allocate the Issue by using the “Assign To” feature in the
left sidebar. This will add a new To Do to the user and also send a message
indicating that this Issue is allocated.
